# Zero-Knowledge Trust

**The Next Evolution of Security for the Agentic Era**

*A framework for understanding why the convergence of zero-trust verification and zero-knowledge cryptography is not just possible—it is architecturally inevitable.*

## About

Zero-Knowledge Trust is a security model in which trust is derived from the mathematical certainty that no party—including the platform itself—can access, observe, or reconstruct the secrets it manages. It is not the parallel deployment of zero trust and zero knowledge. It is their architectural fusion into a single model where verification and privacy are inseparable.

The paper covers:

- **The Trust Paradox** — Why current zero-trust architectures break down in agentic environments
- **The Security Model Landscape** — How zero trust and zero knowledge compare and where they fall short
- **Core Principles** — The five architectural principles of Zero-Knowledge Trust
- **Why It's Inevitable** — Five converging forces making this evolution unavoidable
- **The Path Forward** — Three implementation tiers from hardware-isolated execution to local keystores
